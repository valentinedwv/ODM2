ODM2 Core: Sampling Features
============================

Every Action must be performed on or at a Sampling Feature. For example, a field visit Action is made to a "Site" Sampling Feature. A laboratory analysis Action is performed on a "Specimen" Sampling Feature. In the ODM2 Core schema, only the type of the Sampling Feature and its geometry are given in the SamplingFeatures entity. All other details of the Sampling Feature are encoded within the ODM2 Sampling Features extension. Sampling Features are described in more detail in the section about the [ODM2 Sampling Features](ext_samplingfeatures.md) extension.
