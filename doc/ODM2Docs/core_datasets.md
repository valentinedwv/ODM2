ODM2 Core: Datasets
===================

The Datasets entity is used to encode information about groups of Results that are logically related. A Dataset has a title, an abstract, and is the entity in ODM2 that would receive a citation. A Dataset may consist of a single result or could be a group of many Results. Any particular Result may participate in zero or more Datasets. The following are examples of Datasets that could be represented in ODM2:

* All of the time series Results from a single continuous water quality monitoring site
* All of the measurement Results from an individual Specimen
* All of the Results collected by a particular Person
* All of the Results collected by a particular Organization

ODM2 does not constrain how Results are grouped into Datasets - this is determined by the user.
