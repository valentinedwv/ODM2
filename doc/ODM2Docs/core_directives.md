ODM2 Core: Directives
=====================

The Directives entity is used to encode information about why an Action is performed.  For example, a Directive might state that an Action is performed as part of a particular:

* Project
* Monitoring program
* Field campaign
* Etc.

One Directive may result in many different Actions.  An Action does not have to  be associated with a Directive, but can be associated with only one.  It is up to the user to define the directives under which Actions are performed.
