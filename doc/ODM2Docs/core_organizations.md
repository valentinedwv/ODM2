ODM2 Core: Organizations
========================

Organizations are included in ODM2 so that observations and other Actions can be associated with the Organization responsible for creating or performing them. Organizations are groups of People with a common purpose or goal.  There are many different types of Organizations, including government agencies, academic research groups, private corporations, watershed monitoring groups, etc.  ODM2 does not contrain the types of Organizations that can be represented, but each Organization must have a type that is selected from a controlled vocabulary. The following are examples of Organization types:

* Federal agency
* State agency
* Academic Research Group
* Academic department
* University
* Non-profit
* Etc.

Organizations can have a code (e.g., "USGS"), a name (e.g., "United States Geological Survey"), a full text description, and a URL that links to the Organization's website (e.g., "http://www.usgs.gov"). Organizations can also have a parent Organization in the case of an Organization being a sub-unit of another Organization (e.g., the Utah Water Research Laboratory as a child Organization of Utah State University). 

Organizations are linked to People via Affiliations.  A Person can be affiliated with zero or more Organizations.  Affiliations have beginning and ending dates, and a Person's contact information (e.g., phone, email, address, website) is part of thier affiliation with the Organization. An Action is performed by a Person who may or may not be affiliated with an Organization.
