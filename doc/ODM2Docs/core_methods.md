ODM2 Core: Methods
==================

The Methods entity is used to encode information about the procedure used to perform an Action. Every Action must be performed using a Method. Methods are modeled generically in ODM2 and can be of many types, including:

* Sample collection methods
* Sample preparation methods
* Sample analysis methods
* Observation methods

Methods have a type that is selected from a controlled vocabulary of method types. Each Method has a code and a name and may have a detailed description and link to a URL that provides further details of the Method. Methods may also be associated with an Organization - e.g., in the case that a method was developed by a particular Organization.
